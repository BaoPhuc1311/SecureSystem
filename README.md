# Secure System

## Introduction:
This project is designed to enhance information security by implementing algorithms such as:
- Huffman Coding
- Shannon-Fano Coding
- (...)

The goal is to protect user data confidentiality, ensure data integrity, and reduce storage requirements.

## Objective:
- Compress/Decompress text efficiently using Huffman Coding or Shannon-Fano Coding.
- Implement data hiding techniques using Huffman Coding or Shannon-Fano Coding.

## Requirement:
Python 3.x
